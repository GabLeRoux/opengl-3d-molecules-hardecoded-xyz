# OpenGL 3d Molecules with Hardcoded XYZ
This application is a simple OpenGl project I've made during my Infography Course at [Université du Québec à Chicoutimi](http://www.uqac.ca/) while ago. Some people asked me the code for this on my quick youtube video so here it is.

The code is not so great but it works well. I believe you can use this for learning purpouses of ```OpenGL``` using ```GLUT```.

## Compiling
run ```make``` command in a terminal and have fun. Tested on OSX but could work on other systems.

More info on ```GLUT``` can be found [here](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/courses/eecs487/glut-howto/)
